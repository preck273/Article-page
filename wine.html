		<h1>Tips For Learning More About Wines</h1>
        <h6>July 20, 2020</h6>

		<h2>Wine Basics</h2>
		<p>Most wine is made with grapes, but they're not like the ones you find in the grocery store. Wine grapes (latin name: Vitis vinifera) are smaller, sweeter, have thick skins, and contain seeds. There are over 1,300 wine grape varieties used in commercial production but only about 100 of these varieties make up 75% of the world's vineyards.</p>
		<h2>Chemistry of 'Wine Legs' Inspires Surface-Skimming Minibots</h2>
		<p>Miniature robots hold great promise — tiny bots could help with tasks such as environmental cleanups in the future. But finding a way to power these tiny robotic helpers is a challenge because clean, lightweight and compact fuel sources are hard to develop.Now, a team of engineers from the East China Normal University in Shanghai may have found a solution: They've developed a chemical motor for lightweight robots that can glide along the surface of a body of water. The findings are described in an October study published in the journal Langmuir.</p>
		<p>The chemistry-based minimotor works because of a phenomenon called the Marangoni effect, which describes what happens when two liquids with strong surface tensions interact. The most famous example of the Marangoni effect is the so-called "legs" that run down the side of a glass of wine after the liquid in the cup is swirled. Because of this effect, liquids slip and slide alongside each other instead of mixing together. [Biomimicry: 7 Clever Technologies Inspired by Nature] The team from Shanghai found that concentrated droplets of a solution of polyvinylidene fluoride and dimethylformamide (PVDF/DMF) interacted this way when placed in water — instead of dissolving into the water, the droplet would sit on the surface and spin rapidly, not unlike a motor.</p>
		<p>The team tested out the new chemical motor two ways. First, they put tiny lightweight paper rockets and paper goldfish into a petri dish of water and dropped some PVDF/DMF on their tails. The mock minibots immediately started zipping around the dish in wide circles as the droplet spun around like a propeller. The scientists also tried to use a PVDF/DMF droplet to generate electricity. To do so, they placed a four-armed stirrer that was hooked up to an electromagneton top of a spinning droplet. As the stirrer whirled, it generated electricity. Because the chemical motor doesn't give off any pollution, the researchers said this sort of technology could lead to a new source of clean energy. But, as the arms of the stirrer cut through the water and the droplet, the surface tension of the water decreased, causing the PVDF/DMF "motor" droplet to disperse throughout the water and slow to a halt.</p>
		<p>The new study was a so-called proof of concept, meaning that its main goal was to see if the idea worked. Indeed, the chemical motors aren't quite ready for industrial use, as the current version can propel a paper rocket for only a couple of minutes. But the scientists said they are optimistic that further exploration of the Marangoni effect could lead to a fleet of lightweight, energy-efficient aquatic robots skimming across the water.</p>
		<h2>No, Drinking 'Beer Before Wine' Won't Prevent a Hangover, Study Finds</h2>
		<p>The adage, "beer before wine and you'll feel fine, wine before beer and you'll feel queer" doesn't hold up to scientific scrutiny. A new study finds that the order in which you consume alcoholic drinks won't actually help you avoid a hangover.Rather, drinking too much alcohol of any kind — and in any order — will likely give you a hangover, the study researchers conclude.</p>
		<p>"We didn't find any truth in the idea that drinking beer before wine gives you a milder hangover than the other way around," lead study author Jöran Köchling, of Witten/Herdecke University in Germany, said in a statement. "The truth is that drinking too much of any alcoholic drink is likely to result in a hangover." [11 Interesting Facts About Hangovers]</p>
		<h2>Putting proverbs to the test</h2>
		<p>There is no medically proven way to prevent or treat a hangover — the symptoms of headache, nausea and fatigue that come with drinking too much alcohol. Instead, people sometimes rely on such unproven folk sayings as "wine before beer"; or "grape or grain but never the twain"; or "beer before liquor, never been sicker." Similar folk wisdom on the ordering of wine and beer exist in other languages, including German and French. The new study put these proverbs to the test. The researchers recruited 90 healthy volunteers ages 19 to 40 who agreed to down large amounts of alcohol, for science.</p>
		<p>The participants were divided into three groups. The first group consumed about two and a half pints of beer (with an alcohol content of 5 percent each) followed by four large glasses of wine (with an alcohol content of 11 percent each). The second group consumed the same amount of alcohol, but in reverse order (wine followed by beer). The third group drank only beer or only wine. During the drinking task, the participants were asked to rate their perceived level of drunkness.Afterwards, they spent the night at the study site under medical supervision. The next day, participants were asked about their hangover symptoms; and they were given a score based on the number and severity of those symptoms, such as thirst, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea, stomach ache, increased heart rate and loss of appetite.</p>
		<p>A week later, the participants came back to the study site to perform the drinking task again, but participants in groups one and two were switched to the opposite drinking order. </p>
