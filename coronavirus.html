		<h1>Coronavirus outbreak: Live updates</h1>
        <h6>October 15, 2020</h6>

		<h2>PFIZER WILL NOT APPLY FOR EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION ON ITS CORONAVIRUS VACCINE BEFORE THE THIRD WEEK OF NOVEMBER</h2>
		<p>Pfizer will not be applying for emergency use authorization for its coronavirus vaccine before the third week of November, according to a statement from Albert Bourla, the chief executive officer of Pfizer. This rules out the possibility that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready by Election Day on Nov. 3, as President Trump has been saying, according to The New York Times. "We are operating at the speed of science," Bourla said in the statement. "This means we may know whether or not our vaccine is effective by the end of October." But in order to know whether or not a vaccine is effective, enough people need to be infected with the virus naturally, so "this data may come earlier or later based on changes in the infection rates." An independent committee of scientists will review the complete data and tell Pfizer if the vaccine is effective, according to the statement. The company also needs to collect enough manufacturing and safety data before applying for emergency use authorization, according to the statement.</p>
		<p>In order to get emergency use authorization in the U.S, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requiring that companies provide two months of data on safety of the potential vaccine following the final dose of it on half of the trial participants, according to the statement."Based on our current trial enrollment and dosing pace, we estimate we will reach this milestone in the third week of November."</p>
		<h2>HOCKEY GAME TURNS INTO SUPERSPREADER EVENT</h2>
		<p>A recreational ice hockey game in Florida turned into a "superspreader" event when 14 out of 22 players developed COVID-19 after the game, including players on both teams, according to a new report. The game, which was held on June 16 at an ice rink in Tampa Bay, Florida, involved two teams of 11 players each, Live Science reported. None of the players wore cloth masks — either on the ice or in the locker rooms. The day after the game, one of the players developed a fever, cough, sore throat and headache, and tested positive for COVID-19. In the following four days, an additional 13 players developed symptoms of COVID-19 — eight players were on the same team as the initial case, and five players were on the opposing team.</p>
		<p>The report, published Thursday (Oct. 15) in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, highlights the particular risk of indoor sporting events for spreading COVID-19, the authors said. "The ice rink provides a venue that is likely well suited to COVID-19 transmission as an indoor environment where deep breathing occurs, and persons are in close proximity to one another," the report said. </p>
		<h2>UK MAN DEVELOPS SUDDEN HEARING LOSS AFTER A SEVERE CASE OF COVID-19</h2>
		<p>A man in the U.K. developed sudden and permanent hearing loss in one ear after having a severe case of COVID-19, Live Science reported. His doctors are now warning others to lookout for this rare but serious complication, according to the report. The authors only found five other reports of sudden hearing loss tied to cases of COVID-19 in the literature. Early identification of sudden hearing loss is important because the condition can potentially be reversed with prompt treatment using steroids, the authors wrote in the study published Tuesday (Oct. 13) in the journal BMJ Case Reports. However, for the U.K. patient, treatment only partially improved his hearing. That being said, the authors found only an association and can’t prove that SARS-CoV-2 directly causes hearing loss, Live Science reported. But they note that cells lining the middle ear have been found to have ACE-2 receptors, which SARS-CoV-2 uses to get inside cells.</p>
		<h2>HERD IMMUNITY STRATEGY CALLED 'DANGEROUS' AND 'FLAWED' IN NEW LETTER SIGNED BY 80 RESEARCHERS</h2>
		<p>The idea of using herd immunity to manage the COVID-19 pandemic is a "dangerous" and "flawed" approach, according to a new letter signed by 80 international researchers. The letter, published Wednesday (Oct. 14) in the journal The Lancet, appears to be a response to the Great Barrington declaration, a proposal published earlier this month by three researchers that calls for an end to COVID-19 restrictions in favor of a herd-immunity strategy. Such a strategy, the declaration says, would involve allowing young and healthy people to return to their normal lives and build up immunity to the virus, while protecting vulnerable populations.</p>
		<p>The new letter, called the John Snow Memorandum, after the pioneer epidemiologist John Snow who first tied a London cholera outbreak to a contaminated water pump, calls this herd-immunity concept "a dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence." Evidence shows it is not possible to restrict uncontrolled outbreaks of COVID-19 to particular sectors of society, according to the authors, who include experts in public health, epidemiology, virology, infectious diseases and other scientific fields. "Uncontrolled transmission in younger people risks significant morbidity and mortality across the whole population," they wrote. What's more, understanding who is vulnerable to COVID-19 is complex, and even young and seemingly healthy people have developed long-lasting symptoms after infection with COVID-19, known as "long COVID," the authors said.</p>
		<h2>REINFECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS IS POSSIBLE BUT LIKELY RARE</h2>
		<p>It's possible for people to be reinfected with the coronavirus after having been infected once, but it's rare, according to The New York Times. There have been fewer than five cases of reinfection reported worldwide of the more than 38 million people who have been infected, according to the Times.</p>
