		<h1>Why You Can't Skip Magnesium If You're Taking Vitamin D</h1>
        <h6>September 20, 2020</h6>

		<p>If you find yourself wondering, "Am I getting enough vitamin D?" you should also ask yourself another question: "Am I getting enough magnesium?" In a new review article, researchers stress the importance of getting enough of this mineral, which aids in the metabolism, or "activation," of vitamin D so it can be used by the body.</p>
		<p>"People are taking vitamin D supplements but don't realize how it gets metabolized," study co-author Mohammed Razzaque, a professor of pathology at Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine in Pennsylvania, said in a statement. "Without magnesium, vitamin D is not really useful." [9 Good Sources of Disease-Fighter Vitamin D] Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body after calcium, potassium and sodium, the researchers said. The element activates hundreds of enzymes that are involved in important biological reactions, including the enzymes that play a role in vitamin D metabolism, the review said.</p>
		<p>But many people don't get enough magnesium — a national survey from 2005-2006 found that about half of all Americans didn't consume enough magnesium, the review said. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the recommended amount of magnesium is 400-420 milligrams per day for men, and 310-320 mg a day for women. Previous research has suggested that consuming magnesium can reduce the risk of vitamin D deficiency: A 2013 study found that people who consumed relatively high levels of magnesium were less likely to have low vitamin D levels, compared with people who didn't get enough magnesium.</p>
		<p>It may be that people who get enough magnesium require less vitamin D supplementation to reach adequate vitamin D levels, than they would if they didn't get enough magnesium, Razzaque said. "By consuming an optimal amount of magnesium, one may be able to lower the risks of vitamin D deficiency," he said. Some studies have also found that people with higher magnesium intakes have higher bone mineral density, and a lower risk of osteoporosis, compared with people with lower intakes of magnesium, the researchers said. However, more research is needed to see whether taking magnesium supplements can prevent or treat osteoporosis, according to the NIH.</p>
		<p>Foods high in magnesium include almonds, bananas, beans, broccoli, brown rice, cashews, egg yolk, fish oil, flaxseed, green vegetables, milk, mushrooms, other nuts, oatmeal, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soybeans, sunflower seeds, sweet corn, tofu and whole grains, according to the review.</p>
		<p>It's important to note that if people take magnesium supplements, they should not consume more than the recommended amount, which is 350 milligrams per day for adults. (This limit is for supplements only. It may be lower than the recommended daily amount because the latter includes magnesium from food as well as supplements.) Too much magnesium from dietary supplements can cause diarrhea, nausea and abdominal cramping; and extremely high intakes can lead to irregular heartbeat and cardiac arrest, according to the NIH.</p>
		<h2>What Are Magnesium Supplements?</h2>
		<p>Magnesium is the eighth most abundant element on the earth's crust, and is found in every organ in the human body. The physician Joseph Black first recognized magnesium as an element in 1755, but even before Black's time, physicians were recommending the magnesium carbonate "magnesia alba" for people with an upset stomach. Today, researchers know magnesium plays a part in more than 300 reactions in the body. Magnesium is necessary to synthesize proteins, DNA and RNA. It plays a role in our metabolism, and cells use magnesium to transport calcium and potassium ions across the cell walls. Healthy magnesium levels are key to nerve function, muscle contraction, heartbeat, and healthy bones. Yet all of the magnesium in the average person weighs only 0.8 ounces (25 grams).</p>
		<p>Magnesium is still used as an antacid and a laxative today. As a supplement, magnesium is touted to prevent hearing loss, kidney stones and migraine headaches. Magnesium supplements are also claimed to improve athletic performance, and treat sleep troubles including restless leg syndrome and insomnia. Low magnesium levels have been linked to osteoporosis, anxiety, irritability, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Doctors sometimes recommend magnesium supplements to treat people with high blood pressure, preeclampsia, eclampsia, heart attacks, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) irregular heartbeat, or an unhealthy ratio of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol to LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol.</p>
		<p>Some people with certain chronic conditions — including diabetes, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome — use magnesium supplements to control symptoms. Magnesium is occasionally recommended to ease altitude sickness, hay fever, Lyme disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Magnesium applied directly to the skin is said to treat skin infections and speed up wound healing. Magnesium has also been touted to ease muscle cramps, sensitivity to loud noises and kidney stones. Many Americans do not get enough magnesium, according to the National Institutes of Health. But some groups of people, who have certain diseases or conditions are even more likely to have low magnesium levels. Heavy drinking and alcoholism can result in chronically low magnesium levels, and gastrointestinal conditions such as Crohn's disease and celiac disease can also deplete magnesium levels.</p>
		<p>Older adults tend to have lower magnesium levels than young adults. This happens, in part, because the gut becomes less efficient at absorbing magnesium and the kidneys become less efficient at retaining magnesium with age. Type 2 diabetes can cause the kidneys to excrete too much magnesium, and in turn lead to a magnesium deficit. And some medications, such as diuretics, the heart drug digoxin and penicillamine (used for rheumatoid arthritis) can all interfere with magnesium in the body. The recommended daily intake of magnesium ranges from 320 milligrams to 420 milligrams, depending on age or gender. In fact, a healthy diet can easily provide enough magnesium. Whole grains, nuts, fish, meat, dark green vegetables, legumes and many fruits contain significant amounts of magnesium.</p>
