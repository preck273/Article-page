		<h1>59 priest mummies and statue of unusual god unearthed in Egypt</h1>

		<p>In a span of one month, the number of sealed coffins found at an archaeological dig in Saqqara in Egypt has ballooned from 13 to 59 — and there is more to come — the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities said in a statement. The colorful coffins, which date back to Egypt's 26th dynasty (688 B.C. to 525 B.C.), were found stacked together within or near three burial wells, the ministry said on Oct. 3. The mummies are still preserved within the coffins; and hieroglyphic writing on the coffins indicates that many of the mummies were priests.</p>
		<p>Beside the coffins, they found the remains of 28 small statues. One of the most interesting statues is a nearly 14-inch-tall (35 centimeters) bronze statue of the god Nefertem, who is shown wearing a headdress shaped like a lotus blossom. The headdress is made of red agate stone, turquoise and lapis lazuli, the ministry statement said. In ancient Egyptian mythology, Nefertem was a god associated with lotus flowers and was the son of Ptah, a creator god who was popular in Memphis, the first capital of Egypt. (Saqqara served as the burial ground for Memphis.)</p>
		<p>Another small statue found near the coffins depicts the god Ptah-Soker — an amalgamation of the gods Ptah and Soker. "Saqqara was called Saqqara because of the god Soker. In the Late Period [the time the coffins date to], there was a combination of the god Ptah of Memphis with Soker," Zahi Hawass, a former Egyptian minister of antiquities, said in a video released by the ministry. "This is unique. I have never seen this before," Hawass said of the Ptah-Soker statue. Numerous shabti figurines were also found with the coffins. Ancient Egyptians often buried the dead with shabti figurines, which they believed would work for the deceased in the afterlife. </p>
		<p>Egypt struggled to gain and maintain its independence during the 26th dynasty. At the start of the dynasty the pharaohs were vassals of Assyria however as Assyrian power weakened the Egyptians were able to assert their political independence. However the rise of Persia would spell the end of the dynasty and in 525 B.C. Egypt was conquered by the Persian empire. Work at Saqqara is being conducted by an Egyptian team led by Mustafa Waziri, the secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. Work is ongoing and more coffins and other artifacts are expected to be discovered soon. </p>
		<h2>Ancient Egypt: A Brief History</h2>
		<p>Egyptian civilization has flourished continuously since prehistoric times. While the civilization's rulers, writing, natural climate, religion and borders have changed many times over the millennia, Egypt still exists as a modern-day country. The civilization has always been strongly connected with other parts of the world, bringing in and exporting goods, religions, food, people and ideas. At times ancient Egypt ruled territory outside the modern-day country's border, controlling territory in what is now Sudan, Cyprus, Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Palestine. </p>
		<p>The country was also occupied by other powers — the Persians, Nubians, Greeks and Romans all conquered the country at different points in time. A number of names were used for Egypt in ancient times. A popular ancient name for Egypt was "Kemet," which means the "black land." Scholars generally believe that this name derives from the fertile soil that is left over when the Nile flood recedes in August. </p>
		<p>The flooding of the Nile occurred between June and August and the fertile soil it created was vital to ancient Egypt's survival, with fertility playing an important role in Egyptian religion. The burial of Tutankhamun — in which his penis was mummified erect — is but one example of how important fertility was in the rituals and beliefs of the ancient Egyptians.  </p>
		<p>The country's ancient rulers are referred to today as "pharaohs," although in ancient times they each used a series of names as part of a royal titular, wrote Ronald Leprohon, an Egyptology professor at the University of Toronto, in his book "The Great Name: Ancient Egyptian Royal Titulary" (Society of Biblical Literature, 2013). The word pharaoh actually originates from the term "per-aa" which means "the Great House," Leprohon wrote. The term was first incorporated into a royal titulary during the rule of Thutmose III (reign ca. 1479–1425 B.C.) wrote Leprohon. </p>
		<h2>Prehistory</h2>
		<p>When exactly early hominids first arrived in Egypt is unclear. The earliest migration of hominids out of Africa took place almost 2 million years ago, with modern humans dispersing out of Africa about 100,000 years ago. Egypt may have been used to reach Asia in some of these migrations. Villages dependent on agriculture began to appear in Egypt about 7,000 years ago, and the civilization’s earliest written inscriptions date back about 5,200 years; they discuss the early rulers of Egypt. These early rulers include Iry-Hor, who, according to recently discovered inscriptions, founded Memphis, a city that served as Egypt’s capital for much of its history. When and how Egypt was united is unclear and is a matter of debate among archaeologists and historians.  </p>
		<p>Egypt’s climate was much wetter in prehistoric times than it is today. This means that some areas that are now barren desert were fertile. One famous archaeological site where this can be seen is at the "cave of swimmers" (as it is called today) on the Gilf Kebir plateau in southwest Egypt. The cave is now surrounded by miles of barren desert; however, it has rock art showing what some scholars interpret as people swimming. The exact date of the rock art is unclear, although scholars think that it was created in prehistoric times.  </p>
